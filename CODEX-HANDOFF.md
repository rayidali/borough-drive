# Borough Drive: continuation context

## Export baseline

- Exported September 6, 2026 from the latest published ten-block version, version 4.
- Original source commit: `67c99489185417c9de9e6a7292de5329df00c82a`.
- At export, runtime and model files matched that baseline. Export-only additions were the local server, package scripts, setup instructions, and this handoff. The original hosting identity and Git metadata were omitted.
- The game can run entirely from the included static assets. No backend, Google API key, or live map service is required.

## Open-source repository preparation — September 6, 2026

- The owner authorized a public repository at `https://github.com/rayidali/borough-drive` after local GitHub authentication confirmed `rayidali`.
- Original code, documentation, and independently authored artistic contributions use MIT. Third-party and geographic data terms remain in `THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md` and the original asset credits.
- The repository adds a visual README using the existing Blender renders, contributor documentation, issue/PR templates, and GitHub Actions verification on Node.js 22 and 24.
- Personal setup instructions were replaced with public contributor instructions. Runtime code, geometry, textures, and reference photographs were preserved.
- This publishing request covers the source repository. It does not request a hosted game deployment or a geographic expansion.

## User's objective and feedback

Rayid wants to build a driving game in a recognizable digital twin of New York City, eventually Manhattan and then NYC. The immediate approved scope is ten connected East Village blocks around First Avenue and East 10th Street: East 7th to East 12th, Second Avenue to Avenue A.

The user knows this neighborhood and rejected generic buildings with real business names. Google photorealistic tiles were closer but still did not meet the desired street-level quality. The accepted approach is authored 3D geometry based on actual map footprints and photographic observations. First & 10th is the most individually detailed core and should remain the quality anchor.

Desired atmosphere: cozy, aesthetic, warm, calm exploration, with the relaxed feeling of slowroads.io but substantially stronger geographic and architectural fidelity. Prioritize recognizable facades, building proportions, rooflines, fire escapes, storefront openings, cornices, windows, signage, sidewalk details, materials, and good driving feel. Preserve real geometry while improving lighting and presentation.

Do not mistake a verified business name for a verified facade. Storefront availability and architectural reference dates must remain separately documented. Unknown occupants should stay unnamed; historical signs must remain marked as historical.

## What currently exists

- Ten complete blocks plus four boundary sections, covering three avenues and six cross streets.
- 610 mapped building objects including annexes and boundary context; this is not 610 independently verified facades.
- 77 additional mapped building records with photographic observations in the expansion. Coverage varies from storefront observations to fuller facades.
- Blender-generated Draco GLBs with shared textures, streamed by distance.
- A highly detailed preserved First & 10th core, map travel, walk/drive modes, collision, fixed-step vehicle simulation, street props, warm lighting, and source/accuracy information.
- Business checks dated September 6, 2026 and OSM snapshot dated September 5, 2026. Image dates vary.

This remains a reconstruction prototype with uneven detail. Secondary facades, unknown heights, some road widths, furniture positions, trees, interiors, and unseen geometry are estimated. Do not describe it as a surveyed, fully current digital twin. Browser performance and gameplay have not been measured in this export task.

## Where to work

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `dist/index.html` | Active ten-block game page |
| `dist/reconstruction/viewer.js` and `viewer.css` | Main rendering, interaction, and interface |
| `dist/reconstruction/vehicle.js` | Fixed-step vehicle dynamics |
| `dist/reconstruction/neighborhood-world.js` | Collision, street geometry, navigation |
| `dist/reconstruction/neighborhood-render.js` | Section streaming and instanced props |
| `dist/reconstruction/neighborhood-map.js` | Minimap and travel map |
| `dist/reconstruction/neighborhood.json` | Geometry, facade data, visual sections, prop placements |
| `model-source/neighborhood-observations.json` | Editable photographic observation schedule |
| `model-source/neighborhood-references/` | Detailed architectural and occupancy research records |
| `model-source/build_intersection.py` | Blender recipe for the detailed core |
| `model-source/build_neighborhood.py` | Blender recipe for neighborhood sections |
| `model-source/neighborhood_landmarks.py` | Landmark massing and facade forms |
| `scripts/prepare-neighborhood.py` | Derive mapped geometry from included OSM snapshot |
| `scripts/compile-neighborhood-details.py` | Apply observations and deterministic details |
| `dist/vendor/` | Included Three.js r180 and Draco runtime, with notices |
| `dist/prototype.html` | Earlier generic prototype, preserved for history; not the active game |

## Running and validation

Use Node.js 22 or newer. `npm run dev` serves only `dist/` at http://127.0.0.1:5173. It uses built-in Node modules and needs no dependency installation. `npm run verify` runs the original meaningful vehicle, road, map-spawn, GLB, texture, and module checks.

The exported copy was checked with Node.js 24.19.0: both verification scripts passed, including 2,308 road samples, valid map spawns, boundary driving, braking/reverse/collision, and frame-rate independence. A local HTTP smoke check passed for the page, JavaScript, Draco WebAssembly, core and section GLBs, and map JSON. This was a source/asset/server check, not a browser gameplay or visual performance test.

Use Blender 4.3 or newer only when mesh regeneration is needed. Read `model-source/NEIGHBORHOOD-NOTES.md` for the rebuild order. The preparation script resets derived facade and prop data, so the detail compiler must follow it. Rebuild only the affected neighborhood section where possible, for example:

```sh
blender -b -t 6 --python-exit-code 1 --python model-source/build_neighborhood.py -- --tile block-3-2
```

For optional standalone renders, specify a portable output location:

```sh
blender -b -t 6 --python model-source/render_neighborhood.py -- --output renders/neighborhood
```

Existing model exports are included; do not make Blender installation a prerequisite to opening or editing the viewer. Do not regenerate every model just to inspect the project.

## Suggested next work

After confirming the game opens on Rayid's computer, identify a small set of visible facade inaccuracies together and improve them against dated sources. Then assess actual driving feel and browser frame rate on that device. Preserve the accepted core, verify new geographic expansion before broadening coverage, and keep visual inference distinct from observation. This handoff supplies context; it does not automatically authorize expansion beyond the user's next request.
